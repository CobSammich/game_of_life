There is a [wiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/) that has a lot of information regarding the Game of
Life.

## Three Rules
Conway's game of life boils down to following three rules that define how the cells interact with
their surroundings.

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
